# Driver-drowsiness
This project implements a Drowsiness Detection System using a Raspberry Pi. It monitors the user's eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect drowsiness while driving. Upon detection, the system activates an alarm, turns on a light, and sends an SMS alert. An LCD display notifies the user, enhancing safety and preventing fatigue-related accidents.
